# Fresh-Starts
Single page application (SPA) Social Media Network created in May 2023.

## The Plan
I am creating a Social media network that is a single page application, this was originally part of a university group project for my first year. However, a large number of the group left and the project went unfinished, so I decided to remake it.

The idea is you can find people from your university or doing your course so that you can make friends and meet new people. You will be able to then chat with these people and create group chats. Design your profile to suit your personality and show off new photos to all your followers. There will also be a minigame built into the website to keep users on the site and coming back. Furthermore there will also be features in place to ensure the safety of the users. For example, you will be able to report and block users, moreover there will be a CEOP button which helps to protect against child exploitation online.
